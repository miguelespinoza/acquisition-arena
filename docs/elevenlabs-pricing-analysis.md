## Pilot Program Cost Analysis

**Pilot Parameters**:
- 15 people × 5 sessions each = 75 total sessions
- Session length range: 5-8 minutes

### Cost Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: 5-minute sessions
- Total usage: 75 × 5 = **375 minutes**
- Included minutes: 250 (free)
- Overage: 375 - 250 = **125 minutes**
- Overage cost: 125 × $0.12 = **$15.00**
- **Total monthly cost: $11 + $15 = $26.00**

#### Scenario 2: 8-minute sessions
- Total usage: 75 × 8 = **600 minutes**
- Included minutes: 250 (free)
- Overage: 600 - 250 = **350 minutes**
- Overage cost: 350 × $0.12 = **$42.00**
- **Total monthly cost: $11 + $42 = $53.00**

#### Scenario 3: 6.5-minute average
- Total usage: 75 × 6.5 = **487.5 minutes**
- Included minutes: 250 (free)
- Overage: 487.5 - 250 = **237.5 minutes**
- Overage cost: 237.5 × $0.12 = **$28.50**
- **Total monthly cost: $11 + $28.50 = $39.50**

## Summary

- **Cost range for pilot**: $26-53 per month
- **250 included minutes** covers approximately 1/3 of pilot usage
- **Concurrency limit of 10** should be sufficient for pilot scale
- **Very cost-effective** for testing and validation phase

## Recommendations

1. Creator tier is well-suited for pilot program scale
2. Monitor actual session lengths to refine cost projections
3. Consider upgrading to Pro tier ($99/month, 1,100 minutes) if pilot expands beyond 15 users
4. Track concurrency usage during peak hours to validate 10-request limit sufficiency
